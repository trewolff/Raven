# Raven

The Raven SOAR is a platform for taking in SEIM event data and automating incident response. The main focus is secure, consistent, high-performance, flexible, open source case management and playbook automation.

This is not browser-centric system on purpose. The aim is to reduce the attack surface for IR in high-security environments. No potential for browser extensions or network traffic snooping.
